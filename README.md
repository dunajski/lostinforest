# Lost in forest

### Introduction

I would like to make an simple device to help you get out of woods when you are lost. I have no problem with getting out of forest but my girlfriend do.
Then I figured out that I can make simple device which can lead user how to go back to the position where he started hiking (my gf loves mushrooming).
Additionally to get some experience with embedded devices I want to create this with STM32 MCU.

### How it would work?

Whenever user mark position as start with button then device starts tracking route. Then when you want to go back to start position and you do not know how you can use device again and let device lead you.

### Description below can vary from time to time.

#### HARDWARE:
1. STM32 DISCOVERY f030 kit,
2. LIS3DH sensor.
