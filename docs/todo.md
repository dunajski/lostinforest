### TODO List

1. ~~Add TODO List~~
2. Simple tasks to test makefile and renew coding skills with "bare-metal"
  - blink led with HAL
  - blink led without HAL
  - send few bytes via USART with HAL
  - send few bytes via USART without HAL
3. Choose "working" demo-board (task 2 can enormously help)
  * Nucleo L073
  * Nucleo F401RE with MCU STM32 F405 (soldered?)
  * Discovery F030
4. Send few bytes with SPI/I2C (need in task 5)
  - choose one protocol
  - try to send something between two nucleos? 
5. Learn how to use LIS3DH
  - datasheets
  - examples (github etc.)
  - experimenting
6. Learn mathematics related to using sensor mentioned above
7. Test equations with some sample measurements
8. Interface with user
